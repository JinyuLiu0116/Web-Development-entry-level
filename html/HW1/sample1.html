        <h2><b>Chapter 1</b></h2>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now</p>
        <p>On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature, New Scientist</i>, and all the scientific journals her work had appeared, was a well_thumbed copy of <i>On The Road</i>.</p>
        <p>She has spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote prolaiming that Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</p>
        <p><b>Molly <i>did</i> think she had something better to do.</b></p>
